Summary: 
We looked at 15 schools and compared their budgets, type of school and sizes to each other. We also looked at these 14 schools students and compared their reading and math scores. We calculated how many schools, students, how large each school's budget is, etc. Then we compared the test scores of the students and their respective schools to compare which schools had higher math or reading scores and how many students were passing these subjects. We also calculated how many students were passing overall, using the aforementioned information. We also were able to look at how students performed in reading and math based upon their school size, school budget and school type.

Two Conclusions:
1) When we look at the data amongst these 15 schools, schools that spend less than $585 per students have higher overall passing %'s of 90%. The converse is true as well with schools spending $645-680 per student having the lowest % passing of ~54%.
2) When considering these 15 schools, charter schools have higher overall passing rates of 90% of students passing while district schools have the lowest overall passing rates of 54%.
